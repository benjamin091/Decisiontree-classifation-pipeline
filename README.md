# Decision Tree Classification Pipeline

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline focused on classification using Decision Trees. It covers data import, exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to analyze how dataset characteristics and preprocessing impact the performance of Decision Tree classifiers. Results are documented and analyzed for insights.

## Project Goals

- Work with multiple datasets varying in size, dimensionality, and class distribution.  
- Perform data import, cleaning, preprocessing (handling missing data, scaling, encoding), and classification using Decision Trees.  
- Evaluate performance with multiple metrics and compare validation strategies.  
- Document results with tables, figures, and analysis.

## Tools

- Python 3.x with scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebooks for experiments and visualization

## Datasets

- Diverse datasets differing in sample size, feature count, and number of classes  
- Preprocessing tailored to each dataset's needs

## Approach

1. Data import and exploration  
2. Preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding)  
3. Training Decision Tree classifiers with various hyperparameters  
4. Evaluation using multiple metrics and runtime analysis  
5. Analysis of results considering preprocessing and parameter effects
